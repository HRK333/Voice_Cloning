# Real-Time Voice Cloning
This repository is an implementation of [Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to
Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04558.pdf) (SV2TTS) with a vocoder that works in real-time.
SV2TTS is a deep learning framework in three stages. In the first stage, one creates a digital representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. In the second and third stages, this representation is used as reference to generate speech given arbitrary text.


## Setup

### 1. Install Requirements
1. Both Windows and Linux are supported. A GPU is recommended for training and for inference speed, but is not mandatory.
2. Python 3.7 is recommended. Python 3.5 or greater should work. Using virtual environment is optional.
3. Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#get-packages). This is necessary for reading audio files.
4. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Pick the latest stable version, your operating system, your package manager (pip by default) and finally pick any of the proposed CUDA versions if you have a GPU, otherwise pick CPU. Run the given command.
5. Install the remaining requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 2. (Optional) Download Pretrained Models
Pretrained models are now downloaded automatically. If this doesn't work for you, you can manually download them [here](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/wiki/Pretrained-models).

### 3. Launch the Toolbox
You can then try the toolbox:

`python demo_toolbox.py -d <datasets_root>`  
or  
`python demo_toolbox.py`
